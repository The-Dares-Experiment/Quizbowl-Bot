### For Those Unframiliar with Quizbowl
Quizbowl is a form of academic competition in which two teams of four compete against each other on a set of 20 questions. These questions range in length from four to eight sentences long. Well-written questions get easier as the question goes on, meaning the most obscure information appears in the first sentence of the question, and each subsequent sentence contains more and more "common knowledge" information. In a tournament questions are read aloud by a moderator, and players can answer at any point while the question is being read. Generally, the earlier one is able to answer a given question, the more one knows about the topic being asked about. Take the following example:

'''Question: In this novel, Walter Cunningham is offered a quarter to buy lunch, but his teacher Miss Caroline fails to understand that he'll never be able to pay her back; later, Burris attends his one annual day of school. The narrator sees Link Deas and Mr. Raymond exhibit unusual sympathy, and she finally meets the recluse Boo Radley after an altercation in which, according to the sheriff, Bob Ewell fell on his own knife. For 10 points, identify this novel featuring the lawyer Atticus Finch and the young narrator Scout, a semi-autobiographical work written by Harper Lee.

ANSWER: To Kill a Mockingbird'''

Correctly answering this question in the first sentence indicates substatial knowledge of "To Kill a Mockingbird". 

In a standard round of 20 questions, the distribution of topics is fixed:
  - Science (4 questions)
  - History (4 questions)
  - Literature (4 questions)
  - Fine Arts (3 questions)
  - Philosophy/Social Science (2 questions)
  - Religion (1 question)
  - Mythology (1 question)
  - Geography (1 question)
  
Within each of these topics, question writers can choose to write about anything they want. A literature question can be written on any author to ever publish fiction, including ones that are extremely obscure. However, question writers usually limit the set of topics they ask about based on the intended difficulty of the tournament. A novice-level high school tournament is not going to have a question on "At Swim-Two-Birds".
